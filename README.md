# cc22-23-storyteller


original idea:
An app which takes a sequence of images as input, generates a description of the images, and uses this to generate a short story summarizing the image sequence.

1. About the challenge of generating textual descriptions for images and the need to combine breakthroughs from computer vision and natural language processing.

2. About the elements that comprise a neural feature captioning model, namely the feature extractor and language model.

3. How the elements of the model can be arranged into an Encoder-Decoder, possibly with the use of an attention mechanism.

1. Describing an Image with Text
2. Neural Captioning Model
3. Encoder-Decoder Architecture
